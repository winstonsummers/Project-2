# Project-2 Booky!
Booky is a cataloging app where users can add all the books they own physical or digital copies of.
# Tech Used
Nodejs, Bcryptjs, ejs, jQuery, Express, Sequelize, PostgreSQL
# Hurdles
Some of my biggest hurdles have been mastering the back-end. Getting routes right and especially working with database associations.
# For the Future
I am unsure yet, I don't believe that this app is up to any standards. While I love the concept the exicution was a little beyond me at the time I took it on; there is either a lot of refactoring ahead or I may start from scratch so I build this app in a more straight forward and direct way.
